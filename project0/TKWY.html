                        <p>
                            Takeaway.com is now one of the leading online food market places in the world. 
                            It all began at a family gathering in 2000, when Jitse Groen who was a student, 
                            got the inspiration for Thuisbezorgd.nl.
                        </p>

                        <h1 class="TKWY-headers">What they do</h1>
                        <p>
                            Takeaway.com is a leading online food delivery marketplace, focused on connecting 
                            consumers and restaurants through its platform in 10 European countries and Israel. 
                            Takeaway.com offers an online marketplace where supply and demand for food delivery and ordering meet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The company commenced operations in 2000 when its CEO, Mr. Jitse Groen, founded and launched 
                            one of the worldâ€™s first online food delivery marketplaces, Thuisbezorgd.nl, in the Netherlands.
                        </p>
                        <p>        
                            Takeaway works with participating restaurants that deliver the food themselves, with the Takeaway.com 
                            platform serving as a source of orders for them and facilitating the online payment process. 
                            The marketplace is available for consumers through mobile applications and via the website. 
                            Takeaway.com derives its revenues principally from commissions on the food ordered through its platform and, 
                            to a lesser extent, from online payment services fees.
                        </p>

                        <h1 class="TKWY-headers">The Markets</h1>
                        <p>
                            Takeaway.com holds a leading position in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Austria, Poland, Bulgaria 
                            and Israel, and is also present in Switzerland, Luxembourg, Portugal and Romania.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Takeaway will continue to evaluate opportunities in sizeable, underdeveloped and underinvested countries 
                            that offer attractive long-term growth potential and do not have a firmly established market leader.
